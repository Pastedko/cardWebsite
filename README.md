Carder is a free to use website for playing belot created by Teodor Kovachev - Pastedko.
It can be accessed as a guest and as a user.
Guests can create, join and leave lobbys and play games but do not have access to the profile tab and cannot see previous games or winrate.
Logged in users can acces the profile tab where they can see their match history, winrate and see thier personal information - date of birth, location, gender, email and profile picture. The date of birth, location, gender and profile picture can be edited by clicking the "Edit Profile" button and entering the new information.
The rules of the game of belot are mostly the same with some minor changes due to my personal house rules.
